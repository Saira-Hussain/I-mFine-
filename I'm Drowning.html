			<h1>I'm Fine</h1>
			<h3>I'm Drowning</h3>

				You don't need water to feel like drowning. I can feel it coming, like a monster under my bed. I'm taking notes in class, yet I can't focus cause it's coming, again. I play my music to blare it out, but it doesn't help. Nothing helps. I run to the bathroom, shaking my arms to take it off of me. 
                But it's too late. It's here. It comes in like a wave of water and submerges me, taking me in. I fight it, but the more I fight, the harder it gets to breathe. I collapse in the bathroom, sweaty, shaking, eyes burning from tears. I take a deep breath in, but a deep breath out
                releases tears that cool down my hot cheeks. The walls come in closer and closer, my head pounding, and my chest in agony. I feel like I'm drowning. Drowning in stress, tears, and pain. I'm trying to find the light, the exit, but every time I reach it, I get pulled in more.  
                It strangles me, choking me. Tucking my head in my knees stops the shaking, but keeps the tears coming. I practice my deep breaths, only for me to realize that I can't breathe. Like how an avalanche is triggered by a single moment, a trigger starts this attack, however, finding the trigger is nearly impossible.
                My mind races through my day to find the trigger of this wave, yet none was to be found. This is my new normal. Allah is always watching our struggles, so he sends me what he knew I needed the most. I get a text, and in between the tears, it reads "I love you bestie". Then it's gone. In an instant, I'm able to stand up. 
                As quickly as it came, it's gone. I can breathe again. The water left, and I don't need to fight any longer. Love, that's all I needed. A reminder from my best friend that I have a reason to keep breathing. When you are drowning, there is this moment, right before you take the final deep breath in the water, 
                where your head is exploding and your thoughts are muddled, and you debate whether or not to take that final breathe to end the pain or to fight through for a moment longer. Fighting for that extra moment never feels worth it, the pain is unbearable. You fight to that very last moment, but when you finally let the water in, 
                that's when it's over, the pain is gone. What if you held on, for a moment longer, to fight to the surface, until help comes? Perhaps you can make it, perhaps you can find the reason to fight. What's a little agony if it means survival? At this moment, I realized how important it is to not to take that final breathe, 
                to hold on to the last strand of hope, no matter how thin it appears. The last strand is always the strongest. The last strand for me can be friends, family, and my religion.  This last hope can be the rocks that allow you to stand up to reach the surface to breathe again. When we think we are drowning, it is only because 
                we don't see the rocks beneath up, our foundation, that will help us up. Please, find that hope in your life, no matter how hard it is. It will change your life, it will save you from drowning.
