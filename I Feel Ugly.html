				Right now, I feel absolutely humongous. I looked at myself in the mirror and my thighs the size of Texas 
                greeted me in the morning. I look around to see these girls with their tiny waists, and I can never be 
                like that, because I was never built like that. They say to not worry about what others say, but those 
                same people are the very people that don't share the same issue as me. I just want to hide in bed, where 
                nobody can see me. I'm trying, I'm really trying to look that way you want me to look. I'm sorry that the 
                younger sister wears the larger size. I'm sorry that large fits me more comfortably than medium. I'm sorry 
                that dresses don't look cute on my large waist. I'm sorry that I only look okay in oversized hoodies. I'm 
                sorry that you need to go all the way back to the store because my shoulders are too broad. I'm sorry that 
                even though I have the genetics to look small, that somehow I screwed myself up. I'm sorry that I enjoy eating.
                I'm sorry that I want a second serving of the biryani. I'm sorry that I just don't have the time to run everyday. 
                I'm sorry that I was made this way. It was not my decision. Broad shoulders, huge nose, fat neck, thick thighs, 
                and a waist to match. What does society want? Small shoulders, thin noses, slim necks, small thighs, and a waist
                to match. Our society is messed up, no it's screwed up. I gained some weight? Ok, I'll start running even though
                my weight is normal. I need to not eat as much? Ok, I only eat 3 meals a day, but i'll start counting my calories.
                It's ok if counting calories makes me feel worse, at least it'll make you happy. I have broad shoulders? Ok, I'll 
                go to the gym even though my shoulders are made out of bone. I have a large waist size? Ok, I'll make dua that Allah 
                changes my genetics so my waist size will magically become smaller I don't fit into medium anymore? Ok, I'll wear large 
                and I promise I won't tell anyone. "You should wear some more make-up, you should run more consistently, you should eat 
                better, it's a good thing you wear modest clothing, you're able to hide it". YOU SHOULD SHUT UP. Yes, please help me make 
                better choices, help me loose weight, help me dress better. Help me, don't degrade me. Don't make each other feel any 
                less important or needed. Uplift, not deflate. Guide, don't shun us out. In this society, where new beauty trends are 
                started in a single swipe through social media, we need motivation more than any other person, we need to be reminded 
                of our natural beauty more than reminded of our flaws. Body positivity is not being okay with being overweight, it's 
                about helping each other with our issues but also embracing our flaws. Somedays, we don't feel cute. On the outside, 
                we look like the same person, but on the inside, our insecurities are eating us away. And that's ok. Really. I can 
                go on forever saying how amazing we look, it won't really change much inside right? Someday suck like that. Next 
                time you see someone degrading someone, please step in. Tell that person that they don't know what the other person is 
                dealing with. Have the courage, grab a friend if you need, and lift her up. Tell her that she looks amazing today. Tell 
                her to proud of herself, whether she has perfect skin, or not, whether she has small waists or curvy, whether she has 
                freckles or not, whether she is light-skinned or dark, whether she has straight, curly, firzzy, long or short hair, 
                whether she is tall or short, whether she started on her exercise journey or got lost somewhere in between. Tell her 
                she inherited beautiful genes, her ancestor's hearts, her parents smile, that her eyes shine bright with a certain 
                twinkle only she can carry, a contagious laugh with a beautiful smile. Don't get caught up looking like someone else, 
                in the 7.1 billion people in the world, there is only one of you. I don't look ugly, it's the society that's ugly.
