			<h1>I'm Fine</h1>

				hey or assalamualikum to my Muslims readers, I don't know why you are here, but I do know why I'm here. I'm here to show you what I mean when I say I'm fine. 
                It's the greatest lie I have ever told and will keep telling, even to those I love. Perhaps you feel the same, and maybe you can find comfort in these pages, or anger. Perhaps you will find the right words to express yourself or the right way to keep yourself hidden.
                Perhaps you are just bored or need a break from the chaos in your life. I will keep one rule though. This is a moment of positivity. Sure each chapter may start a little on the darker side, cause life sucks sometimes, but I will always try to end with a small moment of positivity.
                I don't know what you need to make your day better, so, I'll end by saying, I'm sending you the vibes you need to get through the day. Rahnuma, in Urdu means guide, and I hope to achieve just that, guide my mind, and perhaps your, through the perils of life.
                <br><strong>Much love and god bless, Rahnuma</strong></br>
            </p>
