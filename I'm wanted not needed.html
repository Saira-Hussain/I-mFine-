				I'm the girl who is always there for you, in the good and the bad, who will do anything to see your beautiful 
                smile and hear you laugh. I'm the girl who cries with you, protects you from the dark world, and gives you the 
                advice you need. I'm the girl who is a beacon of positivity for you, who will hype you up, who will show you the 
                good in the world, who will wear a smile just for you. I'm the girl who will be your best friend, your number one 
                supporter. I'm the girl who will check in on you, even if we haven't talked in months. I'm the one who will reach 
                out first, so you don't have to. I'm the one who sees the good in you, despite your apparent flaws. I'm the girl 
                who has the quiet shoulder for you to rest on and gives you the hug you crave. Yes, I'm that girl. I'm also the 
                girl who faces my own issues alone. I'm also the girl who cries herself to sleep and screams to let it all out 
                because it's killing her inside. I'm also the girl who wants to exist for you not just when you need her, but when 
                you want her. I'm also the girl who craves for someone to check on her, ask how she's doing, be reached out to 
                first. I'm also the girl who needs some extra love, some extra attention, some extra positivity. I'm also the girl 
                who wants to hear "good morning" and "sweet dreams" from someone she loves. I'm also the girl who wears a fake smile 
                that fools everyone around her. I'm also the girl who can't see the positive in the day and needs to be shown the beauty. 
                I'm also the girl who stresses herself over someone that doesn't even ask if she's okay. I'm also the girl who just 
                needs a quiet shoulder to rest on, to shield her from the chaos, to protect her, to love her, to show her the good, 
                to give her the love she needs. I'm also the girl who needs a hug to comfort her, a chest to lay on to close her eyes, 
                and arms to wrap around to rewind. I'm also the girl who needs someone to give her genuine love, to take her fake smile 
                and give her a genuine smile and a genuine laugh. I'm also the girl who cries for just a call, no, just a text, no, 
                just a word to remind her to keep moving. Yes, I'm also that girl. Is that too much to ask, or should I just be the girl 
                who will do anything for you? We all need others' attention, others' love, but so much of the negativity we face in life 
                comes from others not meeting our expectations. Perhaps, we need to be that girl who will do anything for others, to show 
                them that they need you, not just want you. I challenge you to be that beacon of positivity for others, and maybe, just maybe, 
                someone will return that back to you. 
				<br><strong>Much love and god bless, Rahnuma</strong></br>
